                <i class="fa fa-envelope" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                Email threads provide a critical written record of
                communications that other media cannot maintain. Mailing lists
                can broadcast information to an entire group &mdash; for
                example, all parents of students in a certain class &mdash; but
                can also remain personal between a teacher and a parent if
                necessary. Most modern email supports rich text formatting as
                well, which can provide additional emphasis, and composing the
                written word affords an opportunity for revision.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i class="fa fa-handshake-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                Many opportunities for in-person communication are already built
                in to the school year. Parent-teacher conferences give parents a
                chance to influence the learning experience for their children.
                Open house events introduce the parents to the team responsible
                for their child's learning. Teachers can use these opportunities
                to expand upon their teaching philosophy and class expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                Parents will very likely be able to access a form of instant
                messaging with their children's teachers. This can be a
                necessary form of communication for asking quick questions and
                providing quick notes. This can also allow parents to engage
                more in their child's learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i class="fa fa-folder" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                Students take home material from school nearly every day, and
                this constant exchange of information is critical to family
                involvement in education. Surveys can be an opportunity for the
                student to assign homework to their parent, who can then inform
                the teacher directly about how their child learns and behaves.
                Sending home completed work can encourage students to proudly
                share their work with their family as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i class="fa fa-phone" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                Phone calls are generally the best way to reach someone
                instantly. These can be used to resolve urgent matters, but
                should also be used to communicate positive news. In fact,
                positive news should precede any concerns or requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i class="fa fa-newspaper-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                Class newsletters can be useful for providing updates about the
                class activities. Like any communication, it is important to
                maintain honesty, transparency, and respect. Everything,
                including both the good news and the bad news, is of equal
                importance.
