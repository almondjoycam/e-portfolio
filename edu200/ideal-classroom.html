                    <li>
                        A Koosh ball has many strings of multicoloured rubber in
                        yellow, blue, green, and red.

                    <li>
                        A three-by-three Rubik's cube rests on the mat, solved,
                        with the blue side facing up and the yellow and red
                        sides facing to the side.

                    <li>
                        A plastic tube is filled with a yellow-tinted fluid, and
                        there are metallic sequins shaped like stars amd music
                        notes suspended within.

                    <li>
                        Two rubber puffer balls with spikes, one dark green and
                        the other bright orange, are at either end of the tube.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A handheld white object has three ball sockets arranged
                        in a triangular pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A loop of bumpy plastic elbow joints in blue, purple,
                        and green has been twisted into a serpentine shape.

                    <li>
                        A white plastic bristle brush is on its side, with a
                        textured handle.

                    These are examples of the countless fidget toys that exist.
                    My ideal classroom would have a wide variety of items like
                    these to fidget with to meet a variety of students' sensory
                    needs. Providing students a source of non-disruptive sensory
                    input can help them focus better, learn better, and feel
                    better in the classroom.

                    In this image, two foldable chairs with animal themes are
                    set up next to a table with a blue plastic organiser. This
                    organiser provides a handy way to hold a stereo, three sets
                    of headphones, and an adapter to plug in multiple headphone
                    jacks to the stereo at once.

                    Students learn best in a multitude of diverse ways, and one
                    way to accommodate alternative learning is to provide a way
                    for students to learn through audio recordings. Containing
                    the various audio resources within headphones can be crucial
                    to maintaining the order in a classroom where many things
                    are going on at the same time.

                    This reading corner is a bench against a window, with a
                    cushion and pillows. Greenery fills the window box.

                    Classrooms are often short on space, and so a way to
                    conserve this space would be to set up seating space on top
                    of bookshelves similar to this reading bench. Additionally,
                    natural light and green spaces are very beneficial to
                    learning. Tasking students with watering the plants may even
                    foster a positive sense of responsibility.

                    In this image, there are many different examples of
                    alternative seating choices to choose from! Two tables are
                    lower to the ground, one with wobble cushions set up and the
                    other with cushioned mats. At least two tables have chairs
                    resembling exercise balls with stabilising legs. Many
                    standard plastic chairs are spread throughout the room.
                    There's also a wobble stool visible at one table!

                    Flexible seating such as the examples in this picture make
                    the classroom look more colourful and exciting. It can also
                    offer valuable sensory feedback for students who learn
                    better while moving. I might have to put a wobble stool at
                    my own desk.

                    In this image, rows of desks with chairs and computers face
                    forward. Mathematical diagrams cover not only the white
                    board at the front of the room, but even the walls!

                    My algebra teacher had coated the walls of her room in dry
                    erasable paint, and a frequent class activity was to solve
                    problems by literally writing on the walls. This class made
                    such an impact on me that I haven't forgotten it since, and
                    I'd like to implement something similar in my own classroom.
                    There's something so transgressively appealing about being
                    able and allowed to write on the walls.
