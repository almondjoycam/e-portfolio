        <h3>Technology in the Classroom</h3>
        <h4 id="games">Games</h4>
        <p>
            I have heard many students self-describe as being unable to
            learn and focus, yet I've seen these same students spend hours
            focusing on a video game, learning the game's strategy and lore.
            To me, this means video games are becoming better teachers than
            schools, and so educators must take notes. To succeed in a game
            often requires a lot of trial and error, but the crucial
            difference between games and school is that a game's response to
            failure is to simply respawn and try again. I found the article
            <a href="https://www.socialsciencespace.com/2014/08/how-do-you-successfully-gamify-a-course/"
                target="_blank">How to Successfully Gamify a Course</a>
            to be an excellent resources of some empirically-determined
            strategies for learning gamification.

        <h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4>
        <p>
            A new technology resource I see appearing in schools is some
            form of surveillance software, where teachers are able to
            monitor and even control the content on student devices. As both
            an educator and a technology professional, this highly disturbs
            me. Not only does this level of control decrease trust between
            students and teachers, but these sofwares are in possession of a
            vast amount of data about these students. Since these softwares
            are often proprietary and licensed, the companies providing them
            are looking to make a profit, and I know that data is a valuable
            commodity in the tech industry. I don't want to knowingly
            compromise

        <h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>
        <p>
            One of the most significant benefits of technology in the
            classroom is increasing the accessibility of course content. The
            ability to convert text to speech, speech to text, translate
            languages, and countless other assistive technology features are
            now available to the majority of students. This means that
            students who might not necessarily receive specific
            accommodations can still access content in alternative formats.
            Since accommodations are often reliant on professional medical
            diagnoses, which have a significant cost barrier as well as
            social impact, some students who may need them might not receive
            them. Making assistive technologies available to all students
            can help close this gap.

        <h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
            One of the most important skills learned in school is
            socialisation. Students learn to interact with one another in
            both formal and informal environments by simply being in a
            classroom with others. Technology can foster this collaboration
            both in the classroom and beyond by allowing multiple students
            to build on the same digital project. This can even lead into
            global collaborations, where students can be exposed to many
            different cultures other than their own.
        </p>
        <h4 id="digital-literacy">Digital Literacy</h4>
        <p>
            Since technology facilitates a massive exchange of information,
            it's only expected that there are inaccuracies in resources.
            Using technology in the classroom mandates a critical approach
            to all digital resources. Digital articles can contain false
            information, and there are websites whose authors may not
            possess any relevant credentials. Additionally, the fair use of
            content is important to learn, to ensure that appropriate credit
            is given and all used content has the proper permissions.
            <a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/chatgpt-and-beyond-how-to-handle-ai-in-schools"
                target="_blank" title="ChatGPT and Beyond: How to Handle AI in Schools (Common Sense.org)">Generative
                AI</a>
            that trains on data from the Internet can contain false
            information, licensed or otherwise personal work, and content
            for which creators have not given machine-learning usage
            permissions. As a result, it is crucial to approach digital
            resources in the classroom while being mindful of fair use,
            false information, and digital courtesy.
