            <h3>Philosophy of Education</h3>
            <h4>How do students learn?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn through examples that are tangible and relevant
                to their own lives. They also learn through experiencing
                concepts for themselves, instead of in a isolated environment
                that is disconnected from the outside world. Students are
                members of society, both now and in the future. They need to be
                able to choose how to integrate themselves further into this
                society as time progresses. Students cannot learn from just one
                person, for there is a massive expanse of knowledge in the
                world. One individual cannot possibly be an expert in all
                fields. Instead, each student fulfills their own knowledge
                niche.

            <h4>What should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Students should start by learning a little bit of everything.
                Maths and sciences are just as valued as arts and humanities,
                and an equal emphasis is placed on learning from all cultures
                and societies. The core foundation in all subjects should
                provide a starting point for students to begin learning. I'm not
                the sole example of what a functional adult should know, and so
                the variety of subjects to teach should reflect many more
                possibilities. The students then can use this foundational
                knowledge to build themselves in the direction of their
                interests.

            <h4>Under what conditions do students learn the best?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn best in a safe space, where they can be
                comfortable bringing their own experiences as examples to the
                classroom. A community effort to solve problems in students'
                lives can be a very effective teaching method. If a student
                feels inadequately represented in the classroom, they should
                advocate for themselves and their cultures to be recognised,
                understood, and celebrated in the classroom as well. Similarly,
                the interests of each student should be equally valued and
                celebrated as well. Students should not be pushed to learn
                certain disciplines, nor should their interests in disciplines
                be suppressed in any way.

            <h4>How should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Everything is connected, and no subject is an island. Concrete
                examples from real life can be used to teach many different
                lessons across subject matters. For example, building a bridge
                involves engineering it to not break, calculating the maximum
                load it can hold, choosing materials that are both aesthetically
                pleasing and sturdy, studying bridges from history that have
                both failed and been successful, and using different terminology
                to describe the process to many different audiences. Bridges
                also have a lot of figurative and social symbolism! How do
                actual bridges represent symbolic bridges, and vice versa?

            <h4>What qualities comprise a good teacher?</h4>
            <p>
                The teacher should relate concepts to students in terms of
                tangible examples. Teachers come with their own unique real-life
                experiences that can be shared to better inform students. The
                teacher should discuss their own knowledge niche, and direct
                students to appropriate resources for other knowledge niches.
                The teacher should create a safe space in the classroom where
                the students are free to express themselves and their troubles.
                Learning occurs best when the environment promotes a state of
                safety and comfort.
