            <li>
                <p>Review all the IDEA disability categories. Under which disability category would Petey have been
                    found eligible? Explain your reasons.</p>
                <p>Petey would be eligible for special education under the category Orthopedic Impairment. The IDEA
                    includes cerebral palsy as an example of a cause for orthopedic impairments. He would also be
                    eligible for speech-language services, as his facial deformities prevent Petey from being able to
                    make sounds using his tongue. The IDEA definition for a speech or language impairment includes
                    "stuttering, impaired articulation, a language impairment, or a voice impairment, that adversely
                    affects a child's educational performance."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review the continuum of placements covered in Module 2. With current assistive technology and
                    accommodations, which placement do you feel would be most appropriate for Petey and why?</p>
                <p>Petey is fully capable of receiving communication, and by using a wheelchair and assistive
                    communication device, he should be educated mostly in a general education setting, following the
                    principle of Least Restrictive Environment. He might spend some of the school day in a resource
                    setting for speech and language services, such as helping him practice making sounds as well as
                    using his assistive communication device. Additionally, activities in physical education would need
                    to be adapted so Petey could participate, but he would likely be able to participate alongside
                    nondisabled peers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose a particular age range (elementary, middle, high school). Identify 2 accommodations and 2
                    modifications that would have helped Petey be successful in school. Explain your reasons for
                    choosing each.</p>
                <p>In middle school, Petey would use an assistive communication device to communicate concepts without
                    needing to use his tongue. This device would likely be a touchscreen tablet with alternative and
                    augmentative communication (AAC) capability that sorts words into categories and pairs them with
                    icons, and can read the words aloud.<br />
                    Petey would also benefit from extended time on tests and assignments, because his limited fine motor
                    control would make it difficult to accomplish reading and writing tasks.<br />
                    These tests and assignments might be modified into a closure format to reduce the effort that Petey
                    must expend to complete them as well. The closure format involves replacing questions that expect a
                    written response in complete sentences with a fill-in-the-blank approach.<br />
                    Finally, any oral presentations that Petey would have to do during middle school would be modified
                    so that Petey could complete them in an alternative manner.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Society has evolved in the inclusion of, and services for, people with disabilities. What else might
                    the government and citizens do to help people with disabilities feel seen and welcome throughout all
                    aspects of our society? (Your answer should be at least 4 sentences)</p>
                <p>Perhaps the inclusive practice that would benefit disabled people the most would be making healthcare
                    much more accessible. Healthcare in the United States is prohibitively expensive to a majority of
                    the population. Most of this medical care is provided by the private sector, and so access is
                    determined almost exclusively by the fluctuations of the markets in the private sector. Although
                    Petey found his own family throughout his life and touched countless lives through his story, he was
                    separated from his parents before he could even remember them because they couldn't afford his
                    medical care. He also spent a large portion of his life in a wheelchair that was modified for him by
                    Owen Marsh, one of his caretakers, at his own expense. This was later replaced by a new wheelchair
                    fundraised (and heavily discounted) for him by Trevor Ladd. Petey may have been able to access a lot
                    more benefits, services, and overall enjoyment of life had he been able to access mobility aids and
                    assistive technology devices more easily.</p>
