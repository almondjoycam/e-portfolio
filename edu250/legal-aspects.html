                <p>
                    There are many facets to special education, shaped by different concepts and legislation.

                <h3>Special Education</h3>
                <p>
                    Specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability
                    (Friend&nbsp;4).

                <p>
                    Support services, such as transportation, interpreting, counseling, and therapy, enabling
                    students to receive a free and appropriate public education (Friend&nbsp;4).

                <p>
                    Not directly related to instruction, but allow the education to be accessed.

                    Aids, services, and other supports that are provided in regular education classes to access the
                    general curriculum (Friend&nbsp;5).

                <p>
                    Assistive technology and preferential seating fall into this category.

                <p>
                    The Federal Government now provides financial assistance to states to create and improve special
                    education programs (Friend&nbsp;10).

                <p><em>P.L. 94-142</em></p>
                <p>
                    This law contained the first definitions of many special education concepts that were being
                    argued
                    in the courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also mandated that states follow the law in order to be eligible for federal funding
                    (Friend&nbsp;10).

                <h3>1986 Reauthorization of the EHA</h3>
                <p>
                    This reauthorization of the Education of the Handicapped Act added infant and early childhood
                    care
                    and intervention (Friend&nbsp;10).
                </p>

                    Previously, services were unavailable until children reached the age of three.

                <h3>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 (IDEA)</h3>
                <p>
                    The reauthorization of the EHA in 1990 gave the law a new name as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This added the need for transition planning as students transition between schools as well as to
                    college or into the workforce (Friend&nbsp;10).

                <p>
                    In 1997, the law was expanded to clarify methods of discipline, parental involvement, and the
                    role
                    of general education teachers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2004, the most recent revision added more strategies to resolve disputes between parents and
                    educators (Friend&nbsp;10).

                <p>
                    All disabled students are entitled to a public education, no matter what.
                </p>
                <p>
                    States have programs in place to inform the public and screen students for potential
                    disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Parents and family members must not be asked to pay for special education services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students with disabilities must receive a plan to specialize their instruction appropriately for
                    their needs (Friend&nbsp;12).

                    Separating disabled students from their peers must be appropriately justified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every effort must be made to keep disabled students in the same environment as their peers

                    Tests are unbiased, administered in the child's native language, and appropriate for the child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than one test is used to assess the presence of a disability, and all
                    areas of suspected disability are assessed.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Information regarding student disabilities is confidential, and everyone who accesses this

                    Parents have a right to request access to all records regarding their child, and can dispute
                    potential inaccuracies (Friend&nbsp;13).

                <p>
                    Parents must give consent for their child to be tested, be invited to any meetings regarding
                    their
                    child, and give permission for their child to receive special education services
                    (Friend&nbsp;13).

                <h3>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of&nbsp;1973</h3>
                <p>
                    This law prohibits discrimination based on disability
                    in programs receiving federal funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It mandates equal access to education and other public services by providing reasonable
                    accommodations, and covers a wider range of disabilities, as well as adults (Friend&nbsp;13).

                <h3>Americans with Disabilities Act of&nbsp;1990</h3>
                <p>
                    ADA protects the rights of all individuals with disabilities across both public and private
                    sectors
                    (Friend&nbsp;14).

                <p>
                    Accessible entrances to buildings are mandated through ADA.

                <h3>Inclusion and Collaboration</h3>
                <p>
                    In an inclusive education environment, all students can access learning in the way that works
                    best
                    for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research has shown that students with disabilities learn and perform better when they are
                    included
                    with their peers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    General and special education teachers must work together to teach all their students
                    (Friend&nbsp;21-24).

                <h3>The Role of the Parents</h3>
                <p>
                    Parents can be their child's biggest advocate in education, because they know their child's
                    strengths better than most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, finding time for parents to collaborate with educators can be difficult depending on
                    many
                    social factors (Friend&nbsp;18-19).

                <h3>The Essence of Special Education</h3>
                <p>
                    All students should have a right to education, and many laws in recent history ensure this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to be the most effective, special education involves many different people
                    collaborating to
                    best accommodate each student.
