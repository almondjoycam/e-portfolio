            <p>
                The teacher will open the class demonstrating the process
                of designing a computer program to the entire group.
                Students will spend time brainstorming ideas about a
                computer program or game to create, and then fill out the
                first page of a game design document template.
                Students will then practice further refining their ideas.
                At the end of the class, students are given the opportunity
                to share their ideas with the class.

                                then develop a goal for a game based on the
                                topic.

                                individually to reflect on and minimize
                                the planned scope.
