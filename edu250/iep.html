        <p>
            This video from the Exceptional Children's Assistance Center
            shows some of the highlights of an IEP meeting. The
            multidisciplinary team that participates in IEP decision making
            requires the presence of many people, including those listed below.
        </p>
        <ul class="margin-left">
            <li>Special Education Teacher</li>
            <li>Notetaker</li>
            <li>General Education Teacher</li>
            <li>Parents</li>
            <li>Student</li>
            <li>School Psychologist</li>
            <li>Middle School Representative</li>
            <li>Assistant Principal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The special education teacher took on the role of the team leader,
            who presented all the different parts of the IEP plan to the rest
            of the participants. The notetaker recorded detailed notes of
            everything discussed during the meeting. The general education
            teacher provided both quantitative and qualitative evidence of how
            the student performed in their class. The parents and the student
            each provided their own anecdotal evidence of how the student was
            performing both in and out of school. The school psychologist was
            able to interpret results of any diagnostic testing that the student
            had undergone. The middle school representative was able to plan
            the student's transition from elementary to middle school. Finally,
            the assistant principal represented the school district at the
            meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Student performance data were used to influence team decisions
            primarily when they discussed reducing the time that the student
            spent in a separate special education setting. Both the parents and
            the assistant principal mentioned the student's below average
            performance in classes to argue against this time reduction, and the
            team's ultimate decision was to leave this time unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
            The student receives 45 minutes of separate special education a week
            as one of their services. As an accommodation, the student also is
            given the opportunity to complete written work on the computer,
            instead of writing it out by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the team was discussing the student's accommodation to use a
            computer for written assignments, I noticed that the parents seemed
            very dismissive of assistive technology, asking, &ldquo;Why would
            my child need assistive technology?&rdquo; However, this question
            may also have stemmed from a place of curiosity, since the parents
            likely had a very limited understanding of the full extent of
            assistive technology. The general educator's response to the
            parents' question seemed unsatisfactory to me as well, but the
            parents seemed to understand better. From this, it seems that I, a
            disabled adult, understand disability vastly differently than how
            parents understand their children with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The student left shortly after their IEP meeting began because they
            had to return to class. I found it surprising both that the student
            was not invited to stay for their entire meeting, and that these
            meetings occurred during school hours. Although it makes sense to
            the multidisciplinary team members to meet during their common
            working hours, the parents likely had to miss a partial or full day
            of work to attend the meeting, especially since two parents were
            present. In particular, when the team was discussing the student's
            annual goal, the student might have been able to offer valuable
            feedback on whether they themself thought that the goal was
            attainable.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the parents asked to see an example of a graphic organizer,
            the educators were able to pull one out to show immediately.
            From this, I learned that having recent examples of student work is
            important to bring to an IEP meeting. I was surprised that the
            educators were able to provide this example, because I definitely
            could not have predicted that the parents would ask about that
            specific tool.
