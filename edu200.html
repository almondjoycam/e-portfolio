            <h3>Philosophy of Education</h3>
            <h4>How do students learn?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn through examples that are tangible and relevant
                to their own lives. They also learn through experiencing
                concepts for themselves, instead of in a isolated environment
                that is disconnected from the outside world. Students are
                members of society, both now and in the future. They need to be
                able to choose how to integrate themselves further into this
                society as time progresses. Students cannot learn from just one
                person, for there is a massive expanse of knowledge in the
                world. One individual cannot possibly be an expert in all
                fields. Instead, each student fulfills their own knowledge
                niche.
            </p>
            <h4>What should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Students should start by learning a little bit of everything.
                Maths and sciences are just as valued as arts and humanities,
                and an equal emphasis is placed on learning from all cultures
                and societies. The core foundation in all subjects should
                provide a starting point for students to begin learning. I'm not
                the sole example of what a functional adult should know, and so
                the variety of subjects to teach should reflect many more
                possibilities. The students then can use this foundational
                knowledge to build themselves in the direction of their
                interests.
            </p>
            <h4>Under what conditions do students learn the best?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn best in a safe space, where they can be
                comfortable bringing their own experiences as examples to the
                classroom. A community effort to solve problems in students'
                lives can be a very effective teaching method. If a student
                feels inadequately represented in the classroom, they should
                advocate for themselves and their cultures to be recognised,
                understood, and celebrated in the classroom as well. Similarly,
                the interests of each student should be equally valued and
                celebrated as well. Students should not be pushed to learn
                certain disciplines, nor should their interests in disciplines
                be suppressed in any way.
            </p>
            <h4>How should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Everything is connected, and no subject is an island. Concrete
                examples from real life can be used to teach many different
                lessons across subject matters. For example, building a bridge
                involves engineering it to not break, calculating the maximum
                load it can hold, choosing materials that are both aesthetically
                pleasing and sturdy, studying bridges from history that have
                both failed and been successful, and using different terminology
                to describe the process to many different audiences. Bridges
                also have a lot of figurative and social symbolism! How do
                actual bridges represent symbolic bridges, and vice versa?
            </p>
            <h4>What qualities comprise a good teacher?</h4>
            <p>
                The teacher should relate concepts to students in terms of
                tangible examples. Teachers come with their own unique real-life
                experiences that can be shared to better inform students. The
                teacher should discuss their own knowledge niche, and direct
                students to appropriate resources for other knowledge niches.
                The teacher should create a safe space in the classroom where
                the students are free to express themselves and their troubles.
                Learning occurs best when the environment promotes a state of
                safety and comfort.

            <p>This is an image of various fidget toys.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A circular silicone Pop It has rows of reversible domes, and
                    is coloured with blue, white, and magenta marbled together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Four silicone stretchy ropes are folded over each other, and
                    there's one in blue, green, yellow, and red.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Four closed mesh tubes contain marbles that can be pushed
                    back and fourth, and there's one in lime, magenta, blue, and
                    yellow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A spherical ball is divided into faces, which each house a
                    socket with its own coloured ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A handheld white object has three ball sockets arranged in a
                    triangular pattern.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Two metal rings are joined together with metal clips, and
                    can be moved back and forth together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Five metal spiral rings, which can be rolled up and down
                    fingers, are present; two are silver and two are gold.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Four squishy balls are coloured in blue, pink, and lime
                    green.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Four small squishy animal toys are lined up, and they seem
                    to represent a golden bear, a dark grey elephant, a calico
                    cat, and a bright pink pig.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Two loops of plastic hinges are arranged in the shape of a
                    plus sign. One is green and orange, and the other is red and
                    light blue.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are examples of the countless fidget toys that exist. My
                ideal classroom would have a wide variety of items like these to
                fidget with to meet a variety of students' sensory needs.
                Providing students a source of non-disruptive sensory input can
                help them focus better, learn better, and feel better in the
                classroom.

                In this image, two foldable chairs with animal themes are set up
                next to a table with a blue plastic organiser. This organiser
                provides a handy way to hold a stereo, three sets of headphones,
                and an adapter to plug in multiple headphone jacks to the stereo
                at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students learn best in a multitude of diverse ways, and one way
                to accommodate alternative learning is to provide a way for
                students to learn through audio recordings. Containing the
                various audio resources within headphones can be crucial to
                maintaining the order in a classroom where many things are going
                on at the same time.

                <p>
                    Classrooms are often short on space, and so a way to conserve
                    this space would be to set up seating space on top of
                    bookshelves similar to this reading bench. Additionally, natural
                    light and green spaces are very beneficial to learning. Tasking
                    students with watering the plants may even foster a positive
                    sense of responsibility.

                    In this image, there are many different examples of alternative
                    seating choices to choose from! Two tables are lower to the
                    ground, one with wobble cushions set up and the other with
                    cushioned mats. At least two tables have chairs resembling
                    exercise balls with stabilising legs. Many standard plastic
                    chairs are spread throughout the room. There's also a wobble
                    stool visible at one table!

                    Flexible seating such as the examples in this picture make the

                    valuable sensory feedback for students who learn better while
                    moving. I might have to put a wobble stool at my own desk.

                My algebra teacher had coated the walls of her room in dry
                erasable paint, and a frequent class activity was to solve
                problems by literally writing on the walls. This class made such
                an impact on me that I haven't forgotten it since, and I'd like
                to implement something similar in my own classroom. There's
                something so transgressively appealing about being able and
                allowed to write on the walls.

                Email threads provide a critical written record of
                communications that other media cannot maintain. Mailing lists
                can broadcast information to an entire group &mdash; for
                example, all parents of students in a certain class &mdash; but
                can also remain personal between a teacher and a parent if
                necessary. Most modern email supports rich text formatting as
                well, which can provide additional emphasis, and composing the
                written word affords an opportunity for revision.

                Many opportunities for in-person communication are already built
                in to the school year. Parent-teacher conferences give parents a

                Open house events introduce the parents to the team responsible
                for their child's learning. Teachers can use these opportunities
                to expand upon their teaching philosophy and class expectations.

                necessary form of communication for asking quick questions and
                providing quick notes. This can also allow parents to engage
                more in their child's learning experience.

                Students take home material from school nearly every day, and
                this constant exchange of information is critical to family
                involvement in education. Surveys can be an opportunity for the
                student to assign homework to their parent, who can then inform
                the teacher directly about how their child learns and behaves.
                Sending home completed work can encourage students to proudly
                share their work with their family as well.

                Phone calls are generally the best way to reach someone
                instantly. These can be used to resolve urgent matters, but
                should also be used to communicate positive news. In fact,
                positive news should precede any concerns or requests.

                Class newsletters can be useful for providing updates about the
                class activities. Like any communication, it is important to
                maintain honesty, transparency, and respect. Everything,
                including both the good news and the bad news, is of equal
                importance.
