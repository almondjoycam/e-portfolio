            <h3>Philosophy of Education</h3>
            <h4>How do students learn?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn through examples that are tangible and relevant
                to their own lives. They also learn through experiencing
                concepts for themselves, instead of in a isolated environment
                that is disconnected from the outside world. Students are
                members of society, both now and in the future. They need to be
                able to choose how to integrate themselves further into this
                society as time progresses. Students cannot learn from just one
                person, for there is a massive expanse of knowledge in the
                world. One individual cannot possibly be an expert in all
                fields. Instead, each student fulfills their own knowledge
                niche.
            </p>
            <h4>What should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Students should start by learning a little bit of everything.
                Maths and sciences are just as valued as arts and humanities,
                and an equal emphasis is placed on learning from all cultures
                and societies. The core foundation in all subjects should
                provide a starting point for students to begin learning. I'm not
                the sole example of what a functional adult should know, and so
                the variety of subjects to teach should reflect many more
                possibilities. The students then can use this foundational
                knowledge to build themselves in the direction of their
                interests.
            </p>
            <h4>Under what conditions do students learn the best?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn best in a safe space, where they can be
                comfortable bringing their own experiences as examples to the
                classroom. A community effort to solve problems in students'
                lives can be a very effective teaching method. If a student
                feels inadequately represented in the classroom, they should
                advocate for themselves and their cultures to be recognised,
                understood, and celebrated in the classroom as well. Similarly,
                the interests of each student should be equally valued and
                celebrated as well. Students should not be pushed to learn
                certain disciplines, nor should their interests in disciplines
                be suppressed in any way.
            </p>
            <h4>How should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Everything is connected, and no subject is an island. Concrete
                examples from real life can be used to teach many different
                lessons across subject matters. For example, building a bridge
                involves engineering it to not break, calculating the maximum
                load it can hold, choosing materials that are both aesthetically
                pleasing and sturdy, studying bridges from history that have
                both failed and been successful, and using different terminology
                to describe the process to many different audiences. Bridges
                also have a lot of figurative and social symbolism! How do
                actual bridges represent symbolic bridges, and vice versa?
            </p>
            <h4>What qualities comprise a good teacher?</h4>
            <p>
                The teacher should relate concepts to students in terms of
                tangible examples. Teachers come with their own unique real-life
                experiences that can be shared to better inform students. The
                teacher should discuss their own knowledge niche, and direct
                students to appropriate resources for other knowledge niches.
                The teacher should create a safe space in the classroom where
                the students are free to express themselves and their troubles.
                Learning occurs best when the environment promotes a state of
                safety and comfort.
            </p>

                <p>This is an image of various fidget toys.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A circular silicone Pop It has rows of reversible domes,
                        and is coloured with blue, white, and magenta marbled
                        together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Four silicone stretchy ropes are folded over each other,
                        and there's one in blue, green, yellow, and red.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Four closed mesh tubes contain marbles that can be
                        pushed back and fourth, and there's one in lime,
                        magenta, blue, and yellow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A spherical ball is divided into faces, which each house
                        a socket with its own coloured ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A handheld white object has three ball sockets arranged
                        in a triangular pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two metal rings are joined together with metal clips,
                        and can be moved back and forth together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Five metal spiral rings, which can be rolled up and down
                        fingers, are present; two are silver and two are gold.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Four squishy balls are coloured in blue, pink, and lime
                        green.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Four small squishy animal toys are lined up, and they
                        seem to represent a golden bear, a dark grey elephant, a
                        calico cat, and a bright pink pig.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two loops of plastic hinges are arranged in the shape of
                        a plus sign. One is green and orange, and the other is
                        red and light blue.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are examples of the countless fidget toys that exist.
                    My ideal classroom would have a wide variety of items like
                    these to fidget with to meet a variety of students' sensory
                    needs. Providing students a source of non-disruptive sensory
                    input can help them focus better, learn better, and feel
                    better in the classroom.

                    In this image, two foldable chairs with animal themes are
                    set up next to a table with a blue plastic organiser. This
                    organiser provides a handy way to hold a stereo, three sets
                    of headphones, and an adapter to plug in multiple headphone
                    jacks to the stereo at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students learn best in a multitude of diverse ways, and one
                    way to accommodate alternative learning is to provide a way
                    for students to learn through audio recordings. Containing
                    the various audio resources within headphones can be crucial
                    to maintaining the order in a classroom where many things
                    are going on at the same time.

                <p>
                    Classrooms are often short on space, and so a way to
                    conserve this space would be to set up seating space on top
                    of bookshelves similar to this reading bench. Additionally,
                    natural light and green spaces are very beneficial to
                    learning. Tasking students with watering the plants may even
                    foster a positive sense of responsibility.

                    In this image, there are many different examples of
                    alternative seating choices to choose from! Two tables are
                    lower to the ground, one with wobble cushions set up and the
                    other with cushioned mats. At least two tables have chairs
                    resembling exercise balls with stabilising legs. Many
                    standard plastic chairs are spread throughout the room.
                    There's also a wobble stool visible at one table!

                    Flexible seating such as the examples in this picture make
                    the classroom look more colourful and exciting. It can also
                    offer valuable sensory feedback for students who learn
                    better while moving. I might have to put a wobble stool at
                    my own desk.

                    My algebra teacher had coated the walls of her room in dry
                    erasable paint, and a frequent class activity was to solve
                    problems by literally writing on the walls. This class made
                    such an impact on me that I haven't forgotten it since, and
                    I'd like to implement something similar in my own classroom.
                    There's something so transgressively appealing about being
                    able and allowed to write on the walls.

                Many opportunities for in-person communication are already built
                in to the school year. Parent-teacher conferences give parents a
                chance to influence the learning experience for their children.
                Open house events introduce the parents to the team responsible
                for their child's learning. Teachers can use these opportunities
                to expand upon their teaching philosophy and class expectations.

                Parents will very likely be able to access a form of instant

                providing quick notes. This can also allow parents to engage

                Students take home material from school nearly every day, and
                this constant exchange of information is critical to family

                student to assign homework to their parent, who can then inform
                the teacher directly about how their child learns and behaves.
                Sending home completed work can encourage students to proudly
                share their work with their family as well.

            <h3>Instructional Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                From my own experiences with learning, I find education much
                more interactive and memorable when each of the 5 senses is
                involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instruction by <em>sight</em> involves a student using both
                their sense of sight and their capacity to visualise. A passive
                example of sight instruction would be reading an article about a
                given topic, where the words can be seen and re-read if needed.
                An active example of sight instruction would be creating a map
                or chart to help other students visualise the topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instruction by <em>smell</em>, to me, represents "sniffing out"
                a topic in an investigative way. Research projects are one of my
                personal favourite strategies to investigate a topic. They give
                students an opportunity to not only learn about concepts in
                their own way, but also to connect a topic with their own
                interests and knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instruction by <em>taste</em> is experienced when I can feel,
                and almost taste, the form of words in my mouth as I speak.
                Students can experience this by reading aloud textual content
                about their topic. They can also apply their knowledge further
                in a creative way by presenting about topics in order to teach
                each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instruction by <em>touch</em> can incorporate a personal element
                to learning a topic. Hands-on activities allow students to
                experience content with their own hands. In a similar vein,
                role-playing activities can lead students to connect themselves
                with the topic, and playing games creates an environment that
                encourages active learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instruction by <em>audio</em> occurs when students listen to
                content related to a topic. This can be commonly seen in a
                lecture format, which I have found to be ineffective when it's
                the only form of instruction. However, when combined with other
                senses, it can be a lot more engaging. Listening to songs about
                the topic is also a very helpful way to become familiar with
                information; sometimes I still wake up with the

            <h3>Technology in the Classroom</h3>
            <h4 id="games">Games</h4>
            <p>
                I have heard many students self-describe as being unable to
                learn and focus, yet I've seen these same students spend hours
                focusing on a video game, learning the game's strategy and lore.
                To me, this means video games are becoming better teachers than
                schools, and so educators must take notes. To succeed in a game
                often requires a lot of trial and error, but the crucial
                difference between games and school is that a game's response to
                failure is to simply respawn and try again. I found the article

                A new technology resource I see appearing in schools is some
                form of surveillance software, where teachers are able to
                monitor and even control the content on student devices. As both
                an educator and a technology professional, this highly disturbs
                me. Not only does this level of control decrease trust between
                students and teachers, but these sofwares are in possession of a
                vast amount of data about these students. Since these softwares
                are often proprietary and licensed, the companies providing them
                are looking to make a profit, and I know that data is a valuable
                commodity in the tech industry. I don't want to knowingly
                compromise

            <h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
                One of the most significant benefits of technology in the
                classroom is increasing the accessibility of course content. The
                ability to convert text to speech, speech to text, translate
                languages, and countless other assistive technology features are
                now available to the majority of students. This means that
                students who might not necessarily receive specific
                accommodations can still access content in alternative formats.
                Since accommodations are often reliant on professional medical
                diagnoses, which have a significant cost barrier as well as
                social impact, some students who may need them might not receive
                them. Making assistive technologies available to all students
                can help close this gap.
            </p>
            <h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
            <p>
                One of the most important skills learned in school is
                socialisation. Students learn to interact with one another in
                both formal and informal environments by simply being in a
                classroom with others. Technology can foster this collaboration
                both in the classroom and beyond by allowing multiple students
                to build on the same digital project. This can even lead into
                global collaborations, where students can be exposed to many
                different cultures other than their own.
            </p>
            <h4 id="digital-literacy">Digital Literacy</h4>
            <p>
                Since technology facilitates a massive exchange of information,
                it's only expected that there are inaccuracies in resources.
                Using technology in the classroom mandates a critical approach
                to all digital resources. Digital articles can contain false
                information, and there are websites whose authors may not
                possess any relevant credentials. Additionally, the fair use of
                content is important to learn, to ensure that appropriate credit
                is given and all used content has the proper permissions.

                that trains on data from the Internet can contain false
                information, licensed or otherwise personal work, and content
                for which creators have not given machine-learning usage
                permissions. As a result, it is crucial to approach digital
                resources in the classroom while being mindful of fair use,
                false information, and digital courtesy.
