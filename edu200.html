            <h3>Philosophy of Education</h3>
            <h4>How do students learn?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn through examples that are tangible and relevant to their own lives. They also learn through experiencing concepts for themselves, instead of in a isolated environment that is disconnected from the outside world. Students are members of society, both now and in the future. They need to be able to choose how to integrate themselves further into this society as time progresses. Students cannot learn from just one person, for there is a massive expanse of knowledge in the world. One individual cannot possibly be an expert in all fields. Instead, each student fulfills their own knowledge niche.
            </p>
            <h4>What should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Students should start by learning a little bit of everything. Maths and sciences are just as valued as arts and humanities, and an equal emphasis is placed on learning from all cultures and societies. The core foundation in all subjects should provide a starting point for students to begin learning. I'm not the sole example of what a functional adult should know, and so the variety of subjects to teach should reflect many more possibilities. The students then can use this foundational knowledge to build themselves in the direction of their interests.
            </p>
            <h4>Under what conditions do students learn the best?</h4>
            <p>
                Students learn best in a safe space, where they can be comfortable bringing their own experiences as examples to the classroom. A community effort to solve problems in students' lives can be a very effective teaching method. If a student feels inadequately represented in the classroom, they should advocate for themselves and their cultures to be recognised, understood, and celebrated in the classroom as well. Similarly, the interests of each student should be equally valued and celebrated as well. Students should not be pushed to learn certain disciplines, nor should their interests in disciplines be suppressed in any way.
            </p>
            <h4>How should students be taught?</h4>
            <p>
                Everything is connected, and no subject is an island. Concrete examples from real life can be used to teach many different lessons across subject matters. For example, building a bridge involves engineering it to not break, calculating the maximum load it can hold, choosing materials that are both aesthetically pleasing and sturdy, studying bridges from history that have both failed and been successful, and using different terminology to describe the process to many different audiences. Bridges also have a lot of figurative and social symbolism! How do actual bridges represent symbolic bridges, and vice versa?
            </p>
            <h4>What qualities comprise a good teacher?</h4>
            <p>
                The teacher should relate concepts to students in terms of tangible examples. Teachers come with their own unique real-life experiences that can be shared to better inform students. The teacher should discuss their own knowledge niche, and direct students to appropriate resources for other knowledge niches. The teacher should create a safe space in the classroom where the students are free to express themselves and their troubles. Learning occurs best when the environment promotes a state of safety and comfort.
