                <p>
                    Throughout my own varied experiences with education, I
                    notice patterns. My favourite teachers have been open-minded
                    and encouraging; my least favourite teachers have
                    inaccessible courses with content they don't seem to have a
                    personal connection to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm committed to accessibility because every single
                    individual deserves to thrive. I'm passionate about
                    technology because it can assist in turning this dream into
                    reality, and because it can provide so much insight about
                    ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that the single greatest feeling in the universe
                    occurs when a connection is made&nbsp;&mdash; be it
                    physical, interpersonal, or theoretical. I both teach and
                    learn because I keep seeing glimpses of this feeling of pure
                    joy.

                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>
                    Every person is a diverse individual of infinite dimensions.
                    I am not complete without any of my parts. For as long as I
                    can remember, I've been creating visual art, and the
                    creativity I've nurtured through art influences everything I
                    do. Since then, I've picked up all manner of additional
                    fixations, from the psychology of substances to the
                    fictional linguistics encountered in video games.
                    <em class="w3-large goal">
                        I want to both share my own passions<br />and be moved
                        by the passions of others.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I can't remember it, I'm told that I taught myself to
                    read. I vaguely remember asking my parents to teach me
                    algebra, because the concept of methodically stripping away
                    layers of mystery to reveal one final answer had such
                    marvellous appeal. Even in creating this portfolio, I find
                    myself searching for and learning new concepts about web
                    design and development.
                    <em class="w3-large goal">
                        I never want to stop learning.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a firm believer that both myself and my environment
                    must exist in a state of wellness before any learning can
                    occur. In my own experience, positive self-esteem is
                    fundamental to well-being. However, this attribute is
                    especially rare, because few people come with it; I am
                    constantly reminding myself that sometimes, my internal
                    monologue is unacceptable.
                    <em class="w3-large goal">
                        I aim to uplift myself and everyone around me<br />in
                        order to promote emotional well-being.

                        Instructor at Code Ninjas, Burke, VA<br />March 2022
                        &ndash; present
                    </em>
                    Perhaps what excites me the most about education is its
                    bi-directionality. Within the past year, I have learned more
                    about using the Unity game engine than I could possibly
                    fathom learning on my own, and all solely because I have
                    been teaching it. There are currently 15 children learning
                    Unity at my location, and they've taught me more than they
                    will ever know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When our center is closed, I also hold virtual one-on-one
                    sessions in Unity for several children &mdash; some I know
                    from working with them in-person, and others several states
                    away. It has been incredible watching them develop a passion
                    for the games they create, but perhaps more importantly, we
                    have spent this time building a sense of trust. Often,
                    before we start working on the main game, I get to see their
                    side projects on other platforms and hear about the events
                    of their day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the current global climate of borders, tension, and
                    hatred, the generation of youth is one of the few realms
                    that remain unspoiled. I hope that the lesson I teach that
                    stays for the longest is the lesson to keep an open mind and
                    treat one another with kindness.
